##Further Improvements 
- Mobile Scale: although it can be played on mobile devices, using the inbuilt chrome device mode, it would be beneficial to resize the canvas dependant on the devices screen size.
- Bonus Slot Wheel: it was originally intended to have a slot wheel spin to decide which bonus to apply, with different amount of extra floors and slow speed, with the better ones being rarer.
- Sound in IE and Safari: currently the chosen method of playing audio is not supported in IE and Safari cannot play sound without Quicktime, which can cause the game to not load.
